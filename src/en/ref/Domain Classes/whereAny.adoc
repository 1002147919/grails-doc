=== where



=== Purpose


Defines a new `grails.gorm.DetachedCriteria` instance that uses a disjunction (logical OR).


=== Examples


Basic query:

[source,java]
----
def query = Person.whereAny {
   firstName == "Bart"
   firstName == "Lisa"
}
Person bart = query.find()
----



=== Description


The `where` method defaults to a conjunction (logical AND) for the created query. The `whereAny` compliments the `where` method by allowing the creation of `DetachedCriteria` using a disjunction (logical OR).

For more information on using the `where` method see the dedicated section on <<whereQueries,Where Queries>> and <<detachedCriteria,Detached Criteria>> in the user guide.
