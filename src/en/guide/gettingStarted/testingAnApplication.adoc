The `create-*` commands in Grails automatically create unit or integration tests for you within the `src/test/groovy` directory. It is of course up to you to populate these tests with valid test logic, information on which can be found in the section on <<testing,Testing>>.

To execute tests you run the <<ref-command-line-test-app,test-app>> command as follows:

[source,groovy]

grails test-app
