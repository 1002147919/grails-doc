Grails 3.2 includes GORM 6.0, which is the first release of GORM to feature RxGORM, a clean room implementation of GORM that is reactive, non-blocking and stateless.

Initially the only backing implementation supported is MongoDB, however support for GORM REST client and SQL is planned in the future. Refer to the [RxGORM documentation|http://gorm.grails.org/rx/latest] for more information.
