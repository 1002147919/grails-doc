Although Grails [controllers|guide:controllers] support fine grained interceptors, these are only really useful when applied to a few controllers and become difficult to manage with larger applications. Filters on the other hand can be applied across a whole group of controllers, a URI space or to a specific action. Filters are far easier to plugin and maintain completely separately to your main controller logic and are useful for all sorts of cross cutting concerns such as security, logging, and so on.

虽然，Grails的[控制器|guide:controllers]支持良好的细粒度拦截器，但它们只是对少数控制器有用，当处理大型应用时就会变得很困难。另一方面，过滤器能横跨整组控制器,一个URI空间或者一种具体的操作。相比插件来说，过滤器更容易、更彻底地维护分离你控制器的主要逻辑，也非常有利于像安全，日志等等这样的横切关注点。
