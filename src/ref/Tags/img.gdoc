h1. img

h2. Purpose

Renders an HTML <img> tag for a static resource.

This tag uses g:resource to generate the link to the resource, so it is implicitly aware of the Resources plugin.

h2. Examples

Example usages for the "shop" app:

{code:xml}
<g:img dir="images" file="logo.png" width="40" height="40"/> == <img src="/shop/images/logo.png" width="40" height="40"/>
<g:img uri="/images/icons/add.png"/> == <img src="/shop/images/logo.png"/>
{code}

Note that for backward compatibility, if the Resources plugin is installed this will defer to <r:img> which will include any HTML attributes defined in the image's resource definition, if one exists.
