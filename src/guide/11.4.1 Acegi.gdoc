The Acegi Plugin is built on the "Spring Security":http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/ project which provides a flexible, extensible framework for building all sorts of authentication and authorization schemes.

The Acegi plugin requires you to specify a mapping between URIs and roles and provides a default domain model to model people, authorities and request maps. See the "documentation on the wiki":http://grails.org/plugin/acegi for more information.
