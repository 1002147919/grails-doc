The Spring Security plugins are built on the [Spring Security|http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/] project which provides a flexible, extensible framework for building all sorts of authentication and authorization schemes. The plugins are modular so you can install just the functionality that you need for your application. There is a Core plugin which supports form-based authentication, encrypted/salted passwords, HTTP Basic authentication, etc. and secondary dependent plugins provide alternate functionality such as OpenID authentication, ACL support, etc.

See the [plugin page|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-core] for basic information and the [user guide|http://burtbeckwith.github.com/grails-spring-security-core/] for detailed information.
