h4. The Basics

Testing URL mappings can be done via the @TestFor@ annotation testing a particular URL mappings class. For example to test the default URL mappings you can do the following:

{code:java}
@TestFor(UrlMappings)
class UrlMappingsTests {
	
}
{code}

{note}
Note that since the default @UrlMappings@ class is in the default package your test will need to be in the default package too
{note}

With that done there are a number of useful methods that are defined by the @grails.test.mixin.web.UrlMappingsUnitTestMixin@ for testing URL mappings. These include:

* @assertUrlMapping@ - Asserts a URL mappings is valid for the given URL. This combines the @assertForwardUrlMapping@ and @assertReverseUrlMapping@ assertions
* @assertForwardUrlMapping@ - Asserts a URL mapping is forwarded for the given controller class (note that controller will need to be defined as a mock collaborate for this to work)
* @assertReverseUrlMapping@ - Asserts that the given URL is produced when reverse mapping a link to a given controller and action

h4. Asserting Forward URL Mappings

If you simply want to assert that a given URL maps to a given controller then @assertForwardUrlMapping@ can help. For example, take the following URL mappings:

{code:java}
static mappings = {
    "/action1"(controller: "simple", action: "action1")
    "/action2"(controller: "simple", action: "action2")
}
{code}

The following test can be written to assert these URL mappings:

{code:java}
void testUrlMappings() {
    assertForwardUrlMapping("/action1", controller:'simple', action: "action1")
    assertForwardUrlMapping("/action2", controller:'simple', action: "action2")
    shouldFail {
        assertForwardUrlMapping("/action2", controller:'simple', action: "action1")
    }
}
{code}

h4. Assert Reverse URL Mappings

If you want to check that the right links are produced for your URL mapping when using the @link@ tag in GSP views then @assertReverseUrlMapping@ can be used. An example test is largely identical to the previous listing except you use @assertReverseUrlMapping@ instead of @assertForwardUrlMapping@. Note that you can combine these 2 assertions with @assertUrlMapping@.

h4. Simulating Controller Mapping

In addition to the assertions to assert the validity of URL mappings you can also simulate mapping to a controller by using your @UrlMappings@ as a mock collaborator and the @mapURI@ method. For example:

{code:java}
@TestFor(SimpleController)
@Mock(UrlMappings)
class SimpleControllerTests {
    void testControllerMapping() {
        SimpleController controller = mapURI('/simple/list')
        
        assert controller != null
        def model = controller.list()
        
        assert model != null
    }
}
{code}
