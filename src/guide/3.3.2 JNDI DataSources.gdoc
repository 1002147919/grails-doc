h4. Referring to a JNDI DataSource

Since many Java EE containers typically supply @DataSource@ instances via the "Java Naming and Directory Interface":http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/ (JNDI). Sometimes you are required to look-up a @DataSource@ via JNDI.

Grails supports the definition of JNDI data sources as follows:

{code:java}
dataSource {
    jndiName = "java:comp/env/myDataSource"
}
{code}

The format on the JNDI name may vary from container to container, but the way you define the @DataSource@ remains the same.

h4. Configuring a Development time JNDI resource

The way in which you configure JNDI data sources at development time is plugin dependent. Using the "Tomcat":http://grails.org/plugin/tomcat plugin you can define JNDI resources using the @grails.naming.entries@ setting in @grails-app/conf/Config.groovy@:

{code}
grails.naming.entries = [
    "bean/MyBeanFactory": [
        auth: "Container",
        type: "com.mycompany.MyBean",
        factory: "org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory",
        bar: "23"
    ],
    "jdbc/EmployeeDB": [
        type: "javax.sql.DataSource", //required
        auth: "Container", // optional
        description: "Data source for Foo", //optional
        driverClassName: "org.hsql.jdbcDriver",
        url: "jdbc:HypersonicSQL:database",
        username: "dbusername",
        password: "dbpassword",
        maxActive: "8",
        maxIdle: "4"
    ],
    "mail/session": [
        type: "javax.mail.Session,
        auth: "Container",
        "mail.smtp.host": "localhost"
    ]
]
{code}
